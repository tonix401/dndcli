/**
 * Service aggregator module - Centralizes access to all utility services
 *
 * This module was specifically created to improve code readability by eliminating
 * the massive import lists that were becoming unwieldy
 * (looking at you GameService.ts üëÄ) T_T.
 *
 * Instead of 20+ individual service imports at the top of each file, consumers
 * can now import all needed services from this single module with a cleaner syntax:
 *
 *
 *  * IMPORTANT: To avoid circular dependencies, be careful when:
 * 1. Adding new services that depend on existing services
 * 2. Modifying existing services to depend on other services
 * 3. Creating bidirectional dependencies between services
 * - Try to avoid using this to avoid circular dependencies
 *   like mentioned above this was simply made to help
 *   readability and maintainability of GameService.ts since
 *   it was getting out of hand with the imports
 *
 *
 * If you encounter a circular dependency error, you can resolve it by:
 * - Creating an interface-only file that both dependent services can import
 * - Moving shared functionality to a new utility service
 * - Using dependency injection patterns instead of direct imports
 * - Switching to direct imports for the specific problematic services
 * - Best of luck! üçÄ :D
 *
 * This provides a more maintainable solution while preserving the logical organization
 * of individual service files within the codebase.
